## Description:
In order to build and populate our relational database, we decided to incorporate Entity Framework, 
an open source objectâ€“relational mapping framework, and the many features of .NET 5.0 to create a
modular DataServices project with the potential for real world use. For our database project, the DataServices
project inserts our csv data into a PostgreSQL database and creates our join tables in a logical simplistic manner. .NET 5.0 also gives us the 
ability to incorporate controllers and a view to query data from the database for front-end use. The design of this database and 
DataServices project is modeled around real back-end development in the work force.
